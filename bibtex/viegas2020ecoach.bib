	Abstract = {Enthusiasm in speech has a huge impact on listeners. Students of enthusiastic teachers show better performance. Leaders that are enthusiastic influence employee's innovative behavior and can also spark excitement in customers. We, at TalkMeUp, want to help people learn how to talk with enthusiasm in order to spark creativity among their listeners. In this work we want to present a multimodal speech analysis platform. We provide feedback on enthusiasm by analyzing eye contact, facial expressions, voice prosody, and text content.},
